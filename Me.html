      <p class="content">A 42-year old Filipino who is just starting a new career as web-developer. I graduated as BS Computer Science but I never practiced my profession instead the course of my career took me into a various role in different industries. I, then decided to try the business world. I applied what I have learned from my previous jobs but I wanted more, since one of the previlage we are enjoying these days are great exposure to internet. I remember back then, we could hardly get online and I have to pay Php 60.00 per hour so I could open my email and search on google, but nowadays internet became so powerful that we are in world that everything is "one-click" away, that's how I put it. So, deciding to go on the path of what I have graduated for feels like is a worth a try. So please join me into my new career journey.</p>
